# My Python Mini-Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects I've created while learning the language. These projects demonstrate my basic understanding of Python concepts like:

*   Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
*   Control flow (if/else statements, loops)
*   Functions
*   Basic database interaction
*   Object-oriented programming (where applicable)

I am still learning and improving my Python skills, so these projects are intended to showcase my progress and practice.

## Projects

Here's a brief overview of the projects included:

1.  **Database Connectivity (Cafe Management System):** A simple cafe management system that interacts with a database. It allows users to add, remove, and view data related to menu items, orders, etc. This project demonstrates basic database connectivity using Python.

2.  **Adventure Game:** A small text-based adventure game designed to practice conditional statements (if/elif/else). Players make choices that affect the story's outcome.

3.  **Guess the Number Game:** A classic number guessing game that utilizes loops (while) and basic logic to provide feedback to the player (higher/lower).

4.  **Quiz Game:** A simple quiz game that uses conditional statements to check answers and keep score.

5.  **Rock Paper Scissors Game:** A classic game implemented in Python to practice conditional logic and random number generation.

## How to Run

Most of these projects are single Python files that can be run directly from the command line:

```bash
python project_name.py
